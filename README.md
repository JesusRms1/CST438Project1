## Overview
This is a recipe application that makes use of an API we found [here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis?tab=readme-ov-file). Specifically, mealdb api, that was free , no key required, and no request limit. The app allows the user to create/login into their account. In the app, the user is allowed to browser through recipes based on their area or category. The user can favorite the recipe and it's added to the users home page. From the home page, the user can view the recipes details, from instructions, id, area, category, and type. The user has the option to remove this recipe from his favorites. The user also has a profile page, where it shows the user its information. Theres also a setting page where the user can update credentials or delete either all of favorite recipes or the users account. The user can also sign out of the app through this page.

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on

+ What was the biggest challenge?
  + My biggest challenge throughout this would be connecting/using both styles of navigations in react-native. The solution is messy (nested nav), but works for the purpose of the application. This also includes the removal of a back up button and titles.
+ Why was it a challenge?
  + This was challenging since the format/language for react-native was new to me. I didn't know how to make it work nor did the videos/documents assist directly to our issue.
  + How was the challenge addressed?
    + This challenge was addressed by trail and error. One overflow thread, youtube video, and some chat assistance.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + Favorite part would be the search page and navigation system. 
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + Perhaps preparing the idea/stories/issues of the app better and more detailed. 
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + I would say communication and trust.
